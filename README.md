# TO-DO-list

This is a simple TO-DO list I coded along watching Colt Steele's course ''The Web Developer Bootcamp'' on Udemy.
<br>For some spice of my own I made the design a bit different so as to not be an exact copy of Colt's work.

### Features
* Add new list item;
* Cross-out a list item;
* Remove a list item
